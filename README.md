# CONCLUSION
Every industry is seeing an exponential increase in chatbot use. Healthcare
organizations can share these on their pages and ensure that their clients are
receiving the finest care possible. A bot can support your patients by providing
timely medical assistance or a fast reminder to take their medications. Before
creating a healthcare chatbot, it is essential to conduct research and establish your
objectives. Setting realistic expectations and being careful when planning will
help with the implementation of this software.
The purpose would be to deliver relevant and accurate diagnosis to the user
through the questionnaire type interface providing assurance to the user about
having a proper first basic diagnosis and also giving the user a chance to take
action by suggesting a doctor who would specialize in the area of the predicted
disease. So the user would receive an accurate diagnosis and a suggestion to a
relevant doctor
